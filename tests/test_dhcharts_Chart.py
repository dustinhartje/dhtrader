#      Probably many should have both.  Should they be in the same file?
# TODO confirm all other TODOs have been cleared from this file
# TODO Tests needed (some of these have already been written partially/fully
# Chart __init__stuff, confirm all attributes, check types, check any
#        scenarios where incorrect values can be passed, check any flags that
#        alter attribute calculations
# Chart __str__ and __repr__ return strings successfully
# Chart to.json and to_clean_dict  return correct types and mock values
# Chart.pretty()
# Chart __eq and __ne pass and fail scenarios
# Chart create and outputs (to_json, to_clean_dict, pretty, __str__, __repr__
# Chart store, retreive, delete
# Chart sort_candles - create random datetime candles then sort and confirm
#       each is > datetime of prior in a for loop
# Chart add_candle success and as many failure scenarios as I can dream up
# Chart load_candles success and fail scenarios, including loading a large
#       number from storage for various timeframes.
#       -- Perhaps map out a number of months with expected candle counts for
#          various timeframes and loop through them all, plus ensure last 30
#          days has some decent minimum number in each timeframe
#       -- also confirm rth and eth various timeframes don't load candles
#          outside of the trading_hours closed times
# Chart review_candles success and fail scenarios
#       -- confirm storage candles from bot() to reasonably current
#          (within a week?) for all timeframes
#       -- confirm earliest and latest actually are earliest and latest
#          it looks like I don't necessarily sort them first so maybe add
#          that in the process and then check each candle to confirm it's
#          >= earliest and <= latest
#       -- do a couple of chart setups ensuring I get correct values
#          for a few times on various timeframes including spanning holidays
#          and weekends and adjacent to them

# TODO Go through dhtrades.py every function/class and write out comments
#      here for things that need testing
# TODO think through which tests can be done simply by creating and calcing,
#      and which should pull data from storage to confirm live results
#      Probably many should have both.  Should they be in the same file?
# TODO Check that list against below tests that were transfered from my
#      original manual testing hacks
# TODO write any remaining tests needed here or in class specific files

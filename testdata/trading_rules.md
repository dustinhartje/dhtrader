## Strategy Overview

This strategy trades ES futures based on price action around the 9-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA) on the 1-hour chart. We look for two types of opportunities:

- **BOUNCE (Long)**: Price drops below the EMA and bounces back up
- **REJECTION (Short)**: Price spikes above the EMA and gets rejected back down

## Trading Hours

✅ **ALLOWED**: 18:00 - 15:54 (Sunday evening through Friday afternoon)  
❌ **PROHIBITED**: 15:55 - 17:59 (No new trades during market close)

**Note**: Existing trades can continue running through the close and into the next trading day.

## LONG TRADES (Bounce Setup)

### Step 1: Calculate Entry Target (Each Hour)

1. Look at the **previous hour's 9-EMA value**
   - If market was closed (no 17:00 candle), use the most recent available EMA
2. **Round UP to nearest $0.25**
3. Subtract offset: Entry Target = Rounded EMA - (0 ticks × $0.25) = Rounded EMA

**Example**: Previous hour EMA = 6,852.29 → Round up = 6,852.50 → Entry Target = **6,852.50**

### Step 2: Validate the Hour

Check the **first 1-minute candle** of the new hour:
- ✅ **Open price MUST be ABOVE entry target** → Hour is valid
- ❌ Open price is AT or BELOW entry target → Skip this hour

**Example**: Hour opens at 6,855.25 (above 6,852.50) → ✅ Valid hour

### Step 3: Watch for Entry Signal

Monitor 1-minute candles throughout the hour:
- Wait for price to drop **at least $0.25 BELOW entry target**
- Entry trigger: Low of any candle ≤ (Entry Target - $0.25)

**Example**: Looking for price to drop to 6,852.25 or lower

### Step 4: Enter the Trade

When entry signal triggers:
- **Enter Long at Entry Target price**: 6,852.50
- **Profit Target**: Entry + $40 = 6,892.50
- **Stop Loss**: Entry - $20 = 6,832.50

### Step 5: Manage the Trade

Track price minute-by-minute until one of three exits:

#### Exit 1: STOP HIT (Loss)
- If price drops to $6,832.50 or below → **Exit at $6,832.50**
- Record Low = $6,832.50

#### Exit 2: PROFIT HIT (Win)
- Price must go at least $0.25 past profit target
- If High ≥ $6,892.75 → **Exit at $6,892.50**
- Record High = $6,892.50
- **EXCEPTION**: If this happens in the entry candle, price must also **close** at or above $6,892.50

#### Exit 3: TIME LIMIT (Neutral/Small Loss)
- If neither target hits by 15:55:00 → **Exit at 15:55 open price**
- If trade enters after 15:55, it runs until 15:55 the next day

### Special Cases - LONG

**Both Targets Hit in Same Candle:**
- Exit at Stop Loss ($6,832.50)
- But record High Price as Profit Target ($6,892.50)
- This represents worst-case scenario for risk analysis

**Entry Candle Profit:**
- If profit target is hit in the same candle as entry
- Price must **CLOSE** at or above profit target ($6,892.50)
- If it only wicks to profit but closes below, continue tracking

**15:55 Exit:**
- Do NOT update High or Low from the 15:55 candle itself
- Use whatever High/Low was recorded up to 15:54
- Exit at 15:55 open price

## SHORT TRADES (Rejection Setup)

### Step 1: Calculate Entry Target (Each Hour)

1. Look at the **previous hour's 9-EMA value**
2. **Round DOWN to nearest $0.25**
3. Add offset: Entry Target = Rounded EMA + (40 ticks × $0.25) = Rounded EMA + $10

**Example**: Previous hour EMA = 6,852.29 → Round down = 6,852.25 → Add $10 = **6,862.25**

### Step 2: Validate the Hour

Check the **first 1-minute candle** of the new hour:
- ✅ **Open price MUST be BELOW entry target** → Hour is valid
- ❌ Open price is AT or ABOVE entry target → Skip this hour

**Example**: Hour opens at 6,858.00 (below 6,862.25) → ✅ Valid hour

### Step 3: Watch for Entry Signal

Monitor 1-minute candles throughout the hour:
- Wait for price to rise **at least $0.25 ABOVE entry target**
- Entry trigger: High of any candle ≥ (Entry Target + $0.25)

**Example**: Looking for price to spike to 6,862.50 or higher

### Step 4: Enter the Trade

When entry signal triggers:
- **Enter Short at Entry Target price**: 6,862.25
- **Profit Target**: Entry - $40 = 6,822.25
- **Stop Loss**: Entry + $20 = 6,882.25

### Step 5: Manage the Trade

Track price minute-by-minute until one of three exits:

#### Exit 1: STOP HIT (Loss)
- If price rises to $6,882.25 or above → **Exit at $6,882.25**
- Record High = $6,882.25

#### Exit 2: PROFIT HIT (Win)
- Price must go at least $0.25 past profit target
- If Low ≤ $6,822.00 → **Exit at $6,822.25**
- Record Low = $6,822.25
- **EXCEPTION**: If this happens in the entry candle, price must also **close** at or below $6,822.25

#### Exit 3: TIME LIMIT (Neutral/Small Loss)
- If neither target hits by 15:55:00 → **Exit at 15:55 open price**
- If trade enters after 15:55, it runs until 15:55 the next day

### Special Cases - SHORT

**Both Targets Hit in Same Candle:**
- Exit at Stop Loss ($6,882.25)
- But record Low Price as Profit Target ($6,822.25)
- This represents worst-case scenario for risk analysis

**Entry Candle Profit:**
- If profit target is hit in the same candle as entry
- Price must **CLOSE** at or below profit target ($6,822.25)
- If it only wicks to profit but closes above, continue tracking

**15:55 Exit:**
- Do NOT update High or Low from the 15:55 candle itself
- Use whatever High/Low was recorded up to 15:54
- Exit at 15:55 open price

## Quick Reference Checklist

### Before Each Hour (Both Directions)

- [ ] Get previous hour's 9-EMA value
- [ ] Calculate entry target (round up for long, down for short; add offset)
- [ ] Check first minute: hour opened correctly? (above for long, below for short)
- [ ] Confirm hour is NOT between 15:55-17:59

### Entry Signal

**LONG**: Price drops $0.25 below entry target  
**SHORT**: Price rises $0.25 above entry target

### Active Trade Management

- [ ] Track High and Low every minute
- [ ] Watch for stop loss hit (exit immediately)
- [ ] Watch for profit target + $0.25 (check close if entry candle)
- [ ] Monitor time - must exit by 15:55 if targets not hit
- [ ] Stop tracking High/Low at 15:54 if approaching time exit

### Exit Priority (Highest to Lowest)

1. **STOP LOSS** - Always takes priority
2. **PROFIT TARGET** - Only if stop not hit in same candle
3. **TIME LIMIT** - Only if neither target hit by 15:55

## Risk Management Notes

**Position Sizing**: With $20 stop and $40 profit target, you're risking $100 to make $200 per contract (assuming $5/point for ES micro contracts, or $50/point for standard).

**Win Rate Expectations**:
- Long trades: ~17% profitable historically
- Short trades: ~43% profitable historically
- Despite low long win rate, 2:1 R:R keeps losses manageable

**Daily Limit**: The 15:55 forced exit prevents trades from running indefinitely. Maximum one trade per hour, but most hours won't qualify.

**Gap Risk**: Trades can run overnight. Be aware of overnight gap risk, especially before major news events.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Entering when hour opens AT the entry target (must be above for long, below for short)  
❌ Entering too early - wait for full $0.25 breach of entry target  
❌ Exiting at profit target without seeing +$0.25 past it  
❌ Taking entry candle profit when price only wicks but doesn't close beyond target  
❌ Updating High/Low from the 15:55 exit candle  
❌ Opening new trades between 15:55 and 17:59  
❌ Using current hour's EMA instead of previous hour's EMA
